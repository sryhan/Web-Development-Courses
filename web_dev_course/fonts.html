      No argument here. Kids have names? I am the man with no name, Zapp Brannigan! Now Fry, it's been a few years since medical school, so remind me. Disemboweling in your species: fatal or non-fatal?
      Would you censor the Venus de Venus just because you can see her spewers? Yeah, and if you were the pope they'd be all, "Straighten your pope hat." And "Put on your good vestments." But I know you in the future. I cleaned your poop.
      I don't know what you did, Fry, but once again, you screwed up! <span>Now all the planets are gonna start cracking wise about our mamas.</span> I'll tell them you went down prying the wedding ring off his cold, dead finger.
      Oh, how awful. Did he at least die painlessly? …To shreds, you say. Well, how is his wife holding up? …To shreds, you say. Tell them I hate them. You won't have time for sleeping, soldier, not with all the bed making you'll be doing.
      Stop! Don't shoot fire stick in space canoe! Cause explosive decompression! Interesting. No, wait, the other thing: tedious. It doesn't look so shiny to me. I found what I need. And it's not friends, it's things.
      Are you crazy? I can't swallow that. Uh, is the puppy mechanical in any way? Then throw her in the laundry room, which will hereafter be referred to as "the brig". Or a guy who burns down a bar for the insurance money!
      I don't 'need' to drink. I can quit anytime I want! The key to victory is discipline, and that means a well made bed. You will practice until you can make your bed in your sleep. What kind of a father would I be if I said no?
      What are you hacking off? Is it my torso?! 'It is!' My precious torso! I wish! It's a nickel. When I was first asked to make a film about my nephew, Hubert Farnsworth, I thought "Why should I?" Then later, Leela made the film. But if I did make it, you can bet there would have been more topless women on motorcycles. Roll film!
      Say it in Russian! Fetal stemcells, aren't those controversial? Can we have Bender Burgers again? Why did you bring us here? It's a T. It goes "tuh".
      And I'd do it again! And perhaps a third time! But that would be it. Soon enough. Have you ever tried just turning off the TV, sitting down with your children, and hitting them? Actually, that's still true.
      Also Zoidberg. Look, last night was a mistake. I never loved you. I had more, but you go ahead. No! The cat shelter's on to me. Are you crazy? I can't swallow that.
